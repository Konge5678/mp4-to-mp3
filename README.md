This project is a simple web application that allows users to upload MP4 files and convert them to MP3 format. It uses Node.js and Express for the server-side logic, and ffmpeg for the file conversion.

The application provides a form for users to upload their MP4 files. Once a file is uploaded, it is converted to MP3 format using ffmpeg. The converted file is then downloaded to the user's device. After the download is complete, the uploaded and converted files are deleted from the server to save storage space.
